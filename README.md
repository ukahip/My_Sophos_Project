# Sophos Installation on VMware Workstation Pro.

## Overview
This project documents a **hands-on installation and configuration of Sophos Endpoint Security** in a **VMware virtualized environment**.

The goal is to demonstrate practical experience with **endpoint protection, deployment workflows, and security tooling** in a controlled lab setup.

This lab simulates a real-world enterprise environment where endpoint security must be deployed, managed, and verified.

## Objectives
- Install and configure Sophos Endpoint Security
- Deploy the endpoint agent on a Windows virtual machine
- Validate protection status and policy enforcement
- Gain practical experience with enterprise security tooling

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Sophos Endpoint Security**
- **VMware Workstation**
- **Windows 11 OS**
- **Administrative Configuration via Sophos Console**
